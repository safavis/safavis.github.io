                            <p class="topCardDivResearch">A novel multiple antenna, high-resolution eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing algorithm
                              based on the FFT of the received signal is introduced. The proposed platform overcomes the SNR wall problem
                              in the conventional energy detection (ED) algorithm, enabling the detection of the weak signals at -10 dB SNR.
                              Moreover, the utilization of FFT for the input signal channelization provides a simple, low-power design
                              for a high-resolution spectrum sensing regime. A real-time, low-area, and low-power VLSI architecture is 
                              also developed for the algorithm, which is implemented in a 0.18 um CMOS technology.
                              The implemented design is the first eigenvalue-based detection (EBD) architecture proposed to-date
                              capable of detecting weak signals at -10 dB. Despite having more algorithmic complexity in comparison to the
                              ED, the proposed EBD architecture shows no significant increase in the core area and the power consumption, due
                              to the FFT utilization for the input signal channelization. The proposed design occupies a total area of 3.4 mm^2 and
                              dissipates 78 mW for a 40 MHz sensing bandwidth consisting of 32 sub-channels.</p>

                  <p class="topCardDivResearch">Two techniques were introduced to reduce the computational burden of the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm aiming a real-time implementation to be used for brain signal source
                    localization. To shrink the exhaustive search inherent in MUSIC source localization, the first technique
                    divides the cortical surface into multiple regions based on the forward head model. A novel nomination
                    procedure is proposed to pick a few number of cortical regions to be searched for the active sources.
                    In addition, since the computational complexity of MUSIC is cubically increased with number of electrodes, a new electrode selection algorithm based on the Cramer-Rao bound of the errors is introduced
                    to pick the best set of an arbitrary number of electrodes out of the total. The proposed techniques can
                    reduce the computational complexity by up to 90 %.</p>

                  <p class="topCardDivResearch">We used an optical sensor called photoplethysmogram (PPG) to investigate 
                    the variations in ictal blood ﬂow in limbs. For this part, we had to write an IRB protocol narrative from scratch
                     to be able to record human subjects. More than 40 subjects were recorded among which we only ended up using signal
                      from 12 subjects. The subject were dropped out of the study since they did not have seizures during the time of recording.
                       The PPG signal was recorded from the left ankle of the subjects as well as the surface EEG and ECG signal. 
                       Six diﬀerent features related to hemodynamics from PPG pulse morphology were extracted and their variations were compared 
                       in ictal and pre-ictal phases. A consistent pattern of ictal change was observed across all the subjects/seizures.
                        These variations sometimes precede the seizures by 50 seconds and suggest an increase in vascular resistance due to
                         an increase in sympathetic tone. These features were used to train a neural network based on Long Short Term Memory
                          LSTM architecture for automatic seizure detection. We were able to reduce the False Alarm rate by 50%.</p>
